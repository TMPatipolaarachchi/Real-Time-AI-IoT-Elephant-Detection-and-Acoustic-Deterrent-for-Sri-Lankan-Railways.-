**AI-Powered Solution to Reduce Elephant–Train Collisions in Sri Lanka**

Human–elephant conflicts along railway corridors are a critical conservation and public safety issue in Sri Lanka. Elephant–train collisions result in the loss of elephant lives, train delays, infrastructure damage, and potential risks to passengers.

This project introduces a **real-time AI- and IoT-driven system** that integrates **computer vision, behavior analysis, GPS-based train tracking, risk prediction, and mobile alerts** to proactively mitigate elephant–train collisions.

## 🚶 User Journeys

### 🐘 Elephant Detection and Classification
- Real-time camera-based monitoring of railway zones
- Accurate detection of elephants while filtering non-relevant objects
- Elephant counting and herd classification:
  - Individual elephant
  - Herd
  - Adult–Calf–Adult group

### 🧍 Elephant Behavior Analysis
- Posture-based pose estimation
- Sound-based behavior analysis
- Classification into:
  - Normal
  - Aggressive
- Determines safe activation of deterrent mechanisms

### 🔊 Acoustic Deterrent (Bee Colony Sound)
- Bio-inspired deterrent based on elephants’ natural aversion to bees
- Activated selectively based on behavior and herd type
- **Safety Rule:** Deterrent is disabled for aggressive elephants and adult–calf–adult groups to avoid unintended harm

### 📡 Train Tracking & Distance Estimation
- GPS-based train monitoring within a 10 km radius
- ESP32-based real-time distance calculation
- Continuous distance updates sent to the driver mobile application

### ⚠️ Risk Assessment Module
- Considers:
  - Elephant behavior
  - Herd type
  - Train speed and distance
  - Weather conditions
- Generates a **dynamic risk level** to guide alert severity and driver response

### 📱 Driver Notification System
- **Within 10 km:** Continuous alerts and distance updates
- **Within 1 km:** High-priority emergency alerts
- **Track Clear:** Confirmation message allowing normal train operation
